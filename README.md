TrustLite: A Lightweight Trusted Execution Environment for Microwatt

Project Overview

TrustLite aims to enhance the Microwatt open-source POWER core with a lightweight trusted execution environment (TEE). The project integrates a minimal set of hardware security extensions — including secure boot, AES-128 encryption engine, and a simplified memory protection unit (MPU) — to allow execution of sensitive workloads in an isolated and protected context.

Unlike heavyweight security frameworks, TrustLite is designed to remain compact and resource-efficient, making it suitable for IoT, edge computing, and low-power environments where both performance and silicon area are constrained.
